## **Motivation**
The rapid advancement in artificial intelligence has opened new frontiers in predictive analytics. Businesses and researchers alike require robust models that can analyze data efficiently and predict outcomes with high accuracy. Our project, Karna, aims to fill this gap by providing an advanced AI model tailored for predictive analytics across various domains.

## **Introducing Karna**
Karna is a cutting-edge GenAI solution tailored for data scientists and software engineers to ensure their code adheres to key privacy legislation, including GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and the Privacy Act of 1974. This innovative application features an intuitive chatbot, enabling users to ask detailed questions about the entirety of these legal documents. Additionally, Karna provides powerful tools to analyze and verify your code's compliance with specific laws, ensuring your projects meet all necessary regulatory standards. By leveraging Karna, you can streamline your compliance processes, reduce legal risks, and focus on building high-quality, privacy-compliant software.

## **Data Background**
To ensure the robustness of Karna, we used a diverse dataset encompassing various sectors such as finance, healthcare, and retail. The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and ensure it was suitable for model training. Detailed information about the dataset and preprocessing steps can be found in the `data` directory.

## **Model Training**
The training process for Karna involved several steps:
1. **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and normalizing the dataset.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating relevant features that improve the model's predictive power.
3. **Training:** Using advanced algorithms and techniques to train Karna on the prepared data.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing the model to achieve the best performance.

Detailed scripts and instructions for replicating the training process are available in the `training` directory.

## **Model Inference**
Model inference refers to the process of using Karna to make predictions on new data. We provide detailed documentation and example scripts in the `inference` directory to help users easily deploy the model and interpret its predictions.

## **Model Testing**
To ensure the reliability of Karna, we conducted extensive testing using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The test results, along with the testing scripts, can be found in the `testing` directory. This ensures that Karna performs well across different scenarios and datasets.

## **User Experience (UX)**
A significant aspect of Karna is its focus on user experience. We have developed a comprehensive user interface that allows users to interact with the model easily. The UI includes features for data input, visualization of predictions, and detailed reporting. Instructions for setting up and using the UI are available in the `UX` directory.

## **Key Risks and Future Work**
While Karna represents a significant advancement in predictive analytics, there are always risks and areas for improvement. Key risks include data bias, model overfitting, and the need for continuous updates to maintain accuracy. Future work will focus on:
- Expanding the dataset to include more diverse data sources.
- Improving the model's ability to handle real-time data.
- Enhancing the user interface based on user feedback.
